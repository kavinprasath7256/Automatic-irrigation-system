This is a atmega328 micro controller based projects to automate the irrigation system in agriculture fields with my own logic ,circuit and coding. The main interesting thing in this system is It will automatically detect the fault and display the fault in LCD if any happens. The main purpose of this project is to reduce the manpower and improve water conservation on agriculture forms. In this project is used atmega328p as controller and two solenoid valve to control the water flow across the field also i used lCD display which act as a interface to monitor the current status. float switch is used in water sump to identify the water level and send the signals to micro controller for processing. The display which show the level of the water in sump weather it is low are high and also shows the input voltage and valve operating current. Two water motor pumps are connected in this system which operates alternatively according to the water level which also controlled my atmega328.real time clock is used to provide timings to operate the valve by alternate days accordingly to the date and time setting
